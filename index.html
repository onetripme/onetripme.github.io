    <h1>Hi!</h1>

    <p>Our vision is to make travelling as easy and simple as possible. No annoying ticket booking, no getting lost finding connections and no long waiting times.</p>

    <p>The first step is making booking simpler. We want to bring you a better journey planner with smarter search algorithms that combines all means of transport and lets you book everything in one go.</p>

    <h2>Make an impact</h2>

    <p>Help us understand how you use public transport and how you normally book tickets. Our survey is very short and it'll help us move faster in the right direction. We really appreciate your help so we'll send you an invite to our private beta version when it's ready.</p>

    <p>It's okay if you don't answer all questions. In fact, they're all optional.</p>
